# Online Multi-Agent Pathfinding Research

This is an implementation of online multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) algorithms. Bounded Multi Agent A* (BMAA) is an online MAPF algorithm, which is implemented here along with code for benchmarking. A novel extension to this algorithm, titled Waypoint BMAA is also implemented here.

This work was produced for a final year project in computer science.
