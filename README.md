# Online Multi-Agent Pathfinding Research

This is an implementation of online multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) algorithms. Bounded Multi Agent A* (BMAA) is an online MAPF algorithm, which is implemented here along with code for benchmarking. A novel extension to this algorithm, titled Waypoint BMAA is also implemented here.

This work was produced for a final year project in computer science. The report which describes these algorithms, experiments and results is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yymv4jkdcw9a853/Report.pdf?dl=0).
